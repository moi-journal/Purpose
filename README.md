# The Purpose

## Why am i doing this ?

I'm not **RICH** and I'm not **WISE**, remember those days back in school and college where i had no money while being immature about it.
I was seen as a poor kid. I was underestimated by almost all. I was skinny and not handsome. I was never cool. All i liked was __INSTANT GRATIFICATION__.

=========================

👶🏻 Birth -> I wasn't born __RICH__. I wasn't born __HANDSOME__. I wasn't born wise or __SMART__. I was just born __ORDINARY__ !!! 

======

👦🏻 School -> I wasn't __RICH__. I wasn't __SMART__. I was just an __ORDINARY KID__ back then !!! ( I was just a kid back then 😇 )

======

🧑 College -> I wasn't __RICH__. I wasn't __SMART__. I was just an __BELOW AVG TEEN__ back then !!! ( I wish i was atleast SMART 😔)

======

👨🏻‍🎓  UG -> I still wasn't __RICH__. I still wasn't __SMART__. All i was is an __IMMATURE ADULT__ ( I wish i could go back in time and be both __SMART__ and __RICH__ 😢 )

======

👨🏻 ``` The FUTURE ```
.
.
The reason i'm still the same is because i am not DISCIPLINED, HARD WORKING, CONSISTENT, .............
.
.
.
What should i do ? 😭
