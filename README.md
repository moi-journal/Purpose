# The Purpose

## Why am i doing this ?

I'm not **RICH** and I'm not **WISE**, remember those days back in school and college where i had no money while being immature about it. I was seen as a poor kid. I was underestimated by almost all. I was skinny and not handsome. I was never cool. All i liked was __INSTANT GRATIFICATION__.

---

```👶🏻 Birth``` -> I wasn't born __RICH__. I wasn't born __HANDSOME__. I wasn't born wise or __SMART__. I was just born __ORDINARY__ !!! 

---

```👦🏻 School``` -> I wasn't __RICH__. I wasn't __SMART__. I was just an __ORDINARY KID__ back then !!! ( I was just a kid back then 😇 )

---

```🧑 College``` -> I wasn't __RICH__. I wasn't __SMART__. I was just an __BELOW AVG TEEN__ back then !!! ( I wish i was atleast SMART 😔)

---

```👨🏻‍🎓  UG``` -> I still wasn't __RICH__. I still wasn't __SMART__. All i was is an __IMMATURE ADULT__ ( I wish i could go back in time and be both __SMART__ and __RICH__ 😢 )

---


```👨🏻 The FUTURE  ?```

---

The reason i'm still the same is because i am not DISCIPLINED, HARD WORKING, CONSISTENT, .............
